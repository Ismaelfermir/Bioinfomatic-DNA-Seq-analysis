# Bioinfomatic-DNA-Seq-analysis

The bioinformatic workflow is designed for the detection of single nucleotide  variants (SNV) and small indels (insertions and deletions) from next generation sequencing (NGS) data. This method is implemented and optimized for analize sequencing libraries that use capture probes in DNA extracted from FFPE samples.
